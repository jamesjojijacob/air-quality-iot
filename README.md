# Airduino - Air Quality IoT

This is an air quality monitoring and visualization project implemented with IoT architecture. Air quality data such as temperature, humidity and pollution levels are collected using an Arduino Uno interfaced with various sensors. The data is uploaded to the cloud and visualized in real-time using Matlab.
